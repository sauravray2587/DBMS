Respected Sir,

I write on behalf of Team 2 in OpenSoft GC'19. My team had some lingering questions regarding the OpenSoft event and would be glad if you could address some of them. 

1) What were the queries used to test and on what objective parameters were the results evaluated?
We were quite suprised to see that we received only 2.5 out of 35 in the quality and prevalance section as Query 2 and Query 3 together consisted of 10 marks and our search engine performed quite well in those queries.
We also implemented almost all of the features given in the Other Feature Section in Scoring Criteria but received only 13 out of 35.

2) Given that our website was available only inside the IIT KGP Network, we have our apprehensions about the ability of professor from IIT Kanpur to evaluate on the same.
We also wanted to highlight the fact that on Saturday and Sunday for a long duration the CIC/CSE server was down due to reasons beyond our control and may have caused issues to our link.
